**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.


## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 (name and cnet ID): Alejandra Silva - aosilva
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID): Guillermina Marto - gmarto
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: **AS** **GM**
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

]

num_hospitals = df_st_hospitals.shape[0]
print(f"Number of short-term hospitals reported in the data: {num_hospitals}")

print(df_st_hospitals)

```

The number of short-term hospitals reported in the dataset for Q4 2016 is 7,245.

According to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey, the estimated number of short-term hospitals is 4,500–5,000. Similarly, the CMS Hospital Compare dataset indicates around 4,800 hospitals.

The discrepancy could be due to the narrower definition used in our dataset and the timing of data collection, which only includes hospitals in Q4 2016. Additionally, the CMS dataset might not include hospitals that do not participate in Medicare or Medicaid, which could lead to lower numbers.

## Download Census zip code shapefile (10 pt) 





## Calculate zip code’s distance to the nearest hospital (20 pts) (*)

1. 

The GeoDataFrame, `zips_all_centroids`, has dimensions that correspond to the number of unique ZIP code areas, with two main columns: `ZIP Code` and `geometry`. The `ZIP Code` column holds the specific ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for each entry, representing each distinct postal region. The `geometry` column contains the centroid point of each ZIP code area, with each point indicating the latitude and longitude coordinates for the center of the ZIP code region. This structure allows for further geographic analysis, such as calculating distances to the nearest hospital.

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd

# Calculate centroids for each ZIP code and create a new GeoDataFrame with these centroids
zip_shapefile['centroid'] = zip_shapefile.geometry.centroid  # Calculate centroids

# Convert this information into a new GeoDataFrame, focusing only on the centroids and ZIP code info
zips_all_centroids = gpd.GeoDataFrame(zip_shapefile[['ZCTA5', 'centroid']], geometry='centroid')

# Rename columns for clarity
zips_all_centroids.columns = ['ZIP Code', 'geometry']

# Display the dimensions and column descriptions
print("Dimensions of zips_all_centroids:", zips_all_centroids.shape)
print("Columns in zips_all_centroids:", zips_all_centroids.columns)

# Display the first few rows to verify the output
zips_all_centroids.head()

```

2. 

```{python}

# Define ZIP code prefixes for Texas and its neighboring states
texas_prefixes = list(range(750, 799))
# Adding neighboring state prefixes
bordering_prefixes = texas_prefixes + [70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 87, 88]

# Convert prefixes to strings for matching with the 'ZIP Code' column
texas_prefixes_str = tuple(map(str, texas_prefixes))
bordering_prefixes_str = tuple(map(str, bordering_prefixes))

# Filter the zips_all_centroids GeoDataFrame for Texas ZIP codes
zips_texas_centroids = zips_all_centroids[
    zips_all_centroids['ZIP Code'].str.startswith(texas_prefixes_str)
]

# Filter the zips_all_centroids GeoDataFrame for Texas and bordering states ZIP codes
zips_texas_borderstates_centroids = zips_all_centroids[
    zips_all_centroids['ZIP Code'].str.startswith(bordering_prefixes_str)
]

# Print out the number of unique ZIP codes in each subset
num_texas_zips = zips_texas_centroids['ZIP Code'].nunique()
num_bordering_zips = zips_texas_borderstates_centroids['ZIP Code'].nunique()

print("Unique ZIP codes in Texas subset:", num_texas_zips)
print("Unique ZIP codes in Texas and bordering states subset:", num_bordering_zips)


```

3. 

We used an inner join to retain only the ZIP codes in Texas and neighboring states that have at least one hospital, ensuring that `zips_withhospital_centroids` includes only relevant ZIP codes. The join was conducted on the `ZIP Code` column from `zips_texas_borderstates_centroids` and `ZIP_CD` from `zips_with_hospital`, allowing us to filter specifically for ZIP codes that had at least one active hospital in 2016. The result is a GeoDataFrame, `zips_withhospital_centroids`, which contains only the ZIP codes in Texas or bordering states with at least one hospital in that year.

```{python}

# Step 1: Filter hospitals active in 2016 and count by ZIP code

hospitals_per_zip = combined_df[(combined_df['Year'] == 2016) & (
    combined_df['PGM_TRMNTN_CD'] == "00")].groupby('ZIP_CD').size().reset_index(name='hospital_count')


# Filter to keep only ZIP codes with at least one hospital
zips_with_hospital = hospitals_per_zip[hospitals_per_zip['hospital_count'] > 0]

# Step 2: Merge this count data with zips_texas_borderstates_centroids on ZIP code
# Ensuring ZIP codes match data types between datasets
zips_texas_borderstates_centroids['ZIP Code'] = zips_texas_borderstates_centroids['ZIP Code'].astype(
    str)
zips_with_hospital['ZIP_CD'] = zips_with_hospital['ZIP_CD'].astype(str)

# Perform an inner join to keep only ZIP codes with hospitals in 2016
zips_withhospital_centroids = zips_texas_borderstates_centroids.merge(
    zips_with_hospital, left_on='ZIP Code', right_on='ZIP_CD', how='inner'
)

# Display
display(zips_withhospital_centroids.head())
